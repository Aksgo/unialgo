     DFS is a graph traversal technique used to explore nodes and edges of a graph. It can be implemented using recursion or an explicit stack. The algorithm works by starting from a source node, marking it as visited, and then recursively visiting all its unvisited neighbors.

     Analyzing Time Complexity
    </p>
    <p>
     1. Looping Through Nodes: O(V)
    </p>
    <p>
     • When you start the DFS, you typically loop through all the vertices in the graph. This is necessary to ensure that even disconnected components of the graph are visited.
    </p>
    <p>
     • For each node, you check if it has been visited. This check is O(1) for each node, and since you do this for all V nodes, this part contributes O(V) to the time complexity.

      <strong>Q1: How does DFS differ from BFS?</strong>
     </div>
     <div class="faq-answer">
      DFS uses a depth-first approach, diving deep into a branch before exploring another, while BFS explores nodes level by level, using a queue structure.
     </div>
     <div class="faq-question">
      <strong>Q2: What is the time complexity of DFS?</strong>
     </div>
     <div class="faq-answer">
      The time complexity of DFS is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.
     </div>
     <div class="faq-question">
      <strong>Q3: Can DFS be used to find connected components?</strong>
     </div>
     <div class="faq-answer">
      Yes, DFS can be used to find connected components in a graph by performing DFS on each unvisited node and marking all reachable nodes from that starting node.
     </div>
     <div class="faq-question">
      <strong>Q4: What are the practical applications of DFS?</strong>
     </div>
     <div class="faq-answer">
      DFS is used in topological sorting, finding strongly connected components, and solving maze problems. It’s also helpful in generating paths and in algorithms like finding bridges and articulation points.
     </div>
     <div class="faq-question">
      <strong>Q5: Does DFS guarantee the shortest path in an unweighted graph?</strong>
     </div>
     <div class="faq-answer">
      No, DFS does not guarantee the shortest path in an unweighted graph. BFS is used to find the shortest path in such cases because it explores nodes level by level.
