    <h2>Introduction to Huffman Coding</h2>
    <p>
      Huffman coding is a method used to reduce the size of data without losing any information. It works by giving shorter codes (made of 0s and 1s) to characters that appear more often and longer codes to characters that show up less frequently. This helps to shrink the overall size of the data, making it easier to store or send.    </p>

    <h3>Understanding the Problem with an Example</h3>
    <p>
      Imagine you have sticks of different lengths: a1, a2, a3, ..., an. The task is to merge the sticks, but each merge operation has a cost equal to the sum of the two stick lengths. You want to minimize the total cost of all merging operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you choose larger sticks first, the overall cost becomes high. For example, with sticks of lengths a1 = 1, a2 = 4, a3 = 9, and a4 = 11, if you first merge a2 and a3 (cost = 13), then a1 and the result of a2 + a3 (cost = 14), and finally a4 with the merged result (cost = 25), the total cost is 52.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, if you merge the smaller sticks first (a1 and a2), then proceed with the next smallest, the total cost can be minimized. This strategy reflects the core idea behind Huffman coding: minimizing the immediate merging costs leads to overall lower costs.

        <div class="faq-question">
         <strong>Q1: What is Huffman Coding?</strong>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
         Huffman Coding is a compression algorithm that assigns variable-length codes to input characters based on their frequencies. Characters that occur more frequently are assigned shorter codes, while less frequent characters receive longer codes.
        </div>
        <div class="faq-question">
         <strong>Q2: How does Huffman Coding minimize the cost of merging sticks?</strong>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
         Huffman Coding minimizes the cost by always merging the two smallest sticks first. This strategy ensures that the larger lengths, which contribute more to the total cost, are added later in the process, thus reducing the overall merging cost.
        </div>
        <div class="faq-question">
         <strong>Q3: What role do binary trees play in Huffman Coding?</strong>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
         In Huffman Coding, a binary tree is used to represent the codes. Each leaf node represents a character, and the path from the root to the leaf determines the character's binary representation (0s and 1s).
        </div>
        <div class="faq-question">
         <strong>Q4: Can Huffman Coding guarantee the shortest binary representation?</strong>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
         Yes, Huffman Coding guarantees the shortest possible binary representation for a given set of characters and their frequencies, as long as the characters' bit representations do not prefix each other.
        </div>
        <div class="faq-question">
         <strong>Q5: What is the importance of prefix-free codes?</strong>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
         Prefix-free codes ensure that no code is a prefix of another. This property is essential for uniquely decodable encoding; it prevents ambiguity when decoding the compressed data back into its original form.
